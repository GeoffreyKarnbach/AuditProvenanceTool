This project provides a powerful, interactive tool to **transform high-level, natural language auditing questions into formal, actionable artifacts** like SPARQL queries and JSON trace templates. It's designed to bridge the gap between human-readable compliance policies and machine-readable system logs.

## The Problem

Auditing complex AI systems is challenging. Questions like "Who was involved in processing the patient data?" are simple for humans but difficult to answer from raw logs. This tool formalizes such questions, making AI systems more transparent and accountable.

## How It Works

The tool guides the user through a simple yet powerful workflow, orchestrated by a robust microservice architecture.

![System Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeoffreyKarnbach/AuditProvenanceTool/main/docs/_media/workflow.png)

1.  **‚úçÔ∏è Provide Inputs:** You upload two files: a formal description of your AI system (`.ttl` file) and a list of plain-text auditing questions (`.txt` file).
2.  **üß† Automated Analysis:** The system's backend services work in parallel. An NLP pipeline analyzes your questions, while a semantic analyzer parses your system's structure.
3.  **ü§ù Interactive Clarification:** This is the core of the tool. If a question is ambiguous (e.g., does "process data" mean _pre-processing_ or _post-processing_?), the UI presents you with the options from your system description, and you make the final choice.
4.  **üéÅ Receive Artifacts:** Based on your clarifications, the tool generates a `.zip` archive containing executable SPARQL queries and JSON trace templates, ready for use in your auditing environment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Semantic Workflow Parsing:** Uses Apache Jena to understand complex AI system descriptions based on formal ontologies like PROV-O and P-Plan.
- **Multi-Stage NLP Pipeline:** Questions are rewritten, formalized into Subject-Predicate-Object triplets, and mapped to core provenance concepts.
- **Interactive Ambiguity Resolution:** An elegant Angular UI ensures that the final outputs are accurate and reflect the user's true intent.
- **Polyglot Microservice Architecture:** Leverages the strengths of multiple technologies: **Java** for robust orchestration and semantic web processing, **Python** for its rich NLP ecosystem, and **Angular** for a modern user interface.
